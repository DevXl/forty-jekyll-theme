The **TseLab** at the Psychological and Brain Sciences department of Dartmouth College is focused on finding the neural basis of some of the most high-level functionalities of the brain (e.g. consciousness, volitional attention, creativity, intelligence) by using neuroscientific methods to answer one small question at a time. As a second-year Ph.D. student in this lab, my research is also directed toward the big questions. I use visual illusions to study how/when the mistakes that the early visual cortex makes in representing veridical information are experienced in conscious perception.
